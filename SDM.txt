Software Company's perspective
------------------------------


1. prior to project award ---> internal(in-house)/external(other organisation)
   a. EoI(Expression of Interest)(tender  notice)--> Quotes/proposals(technical, financial, duration)
   b. nogos//project award ---> Work order  --->MoU/MoA (Memorandum of Understanding/Agreement)

2. during design/dev/test (development team)
   a. Req analysis ---> SRS
   b. Design --->SDS --> DB/UI/Business logic --> UML Diag
   c. Development --> User Doc+Developer doc + software (Software Engineers)
   d. testing --->STD
   e. Deployment

3. post deployment (Operations team/ maintenance team) X months warranty free  (% of diviation is mentioned in MoA)
   a. stackeholder/user feedback
   b. change management

4. AMC(Annual Maintenance Contract (costing)(10%-15-20% of the initial cost)

Management
----------

1. review the initial proposal
2. exucute the MoU/MoA
3. Tacking the progress of the project
4. tracking the finance inflow/outflow
5. project closure

2. during design/dev/test (development team)
  waterfall model
	SRS made --> Verified and accepted
	Design doc---> verified and accepted by tech lead
	developement
	Testing
	Deployment

Spiral 
------
System Feasibility ---> check whether the system is feasible to be completed on all aspects(Finance/timeline)
if it is found feasible, move to second loop
if it is not feasible, (time not feasible)---> negotiate(client/internal)SPOC--->Single Point Of Contact
if it is not feasible, (financially not feasible)---> negotiate (Client/Internal)


______________________________________________________________________________
Reuse oriented model
--------------------

Creating a e-Commerce site----> online payment gateway integration--->actual payment program is executed st the bank side(web service/microservice/API).  

main application is connected with many other applications to fetch/push data.
(irctc)						(flights)---> all the connected airline systems
sending data abt (source, dest.n, date, ....(JSON/XML))		they accept the data and filters the data at their end and returns the result(JSON/XML)

accept the result coming back, show them in a user friendly manner
